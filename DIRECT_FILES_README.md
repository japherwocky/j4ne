# Direct Files Cleanup

This document explains the cleanup of duplicate files that were previously in both the root directory and the `tools/` directory.

## Previous Status

There were duplicate files in the root directory and the `tools/` directory:
- `direct_client.py` and `tools/direct_client.py`
- `direct_tools.py` and `tools/direct_tools.py`
- `test_direct_tools.py` and `tests/test_direct_tools.py`

## Current Status

The duplicate files have been removed from the root directory, and all imports have been updated to use the versions in the `tools/` directory.

## Files Removed

The following files have been removed from the root directory:
- `direct_client.py` (use `tools/direct_client.py` instead)
- `direct_tools.py` (use `tools/direct_tools.py` instead)
- `test_direct_tools.py` (use `tests/test_direct_tools.py` instead)

## Import Changes

All imports have been updated to use the versions in the `tools/` directory:

```python
# Before
from direct_client import DirectClient
from direct_tools import (...)

# After
from tools.direct_client import DirectClient
from tools.direct_tools import (...)
```
